## 👋 Hi, We Are the Temporal Error Monitoring (TEM) Group

**TEM-Opus2020/TEM-Opus2020** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

The Temporal Error Monitoring (TEM) Group investigates the neural mechanisms underlying temporal error processing across species.
By combining human EEG research at the Institute of Psychology, Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) and rodent electrophysiology at NeuroPSI, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, we explore how the brain monitors and adapts to timing errors — shedding light on cognitive control, learning, and decision-making.

🔬 Research Focus

Cross-species experimental design and data acquisition

EEG and rodent electrophysiology preprocessing and advanced analysis

Comparative studies of temporal error dynamics in humans and rats

Integration of computational modeling and statistical methods to interpret neural data

🧠 Supervision and Leadership

Dr. Tadeusz W. Kononowicz
Principal Investigator
Expert in cognitive neuroscience, neural timing, and error monitoring

👩‍🔬 Team Members

Sena Nur Bilgin – Ph.D. Researcher

Dunia Giomo – Postdoctoral Researcher

Léa Le Barillier – Postdoctoral Researcher

🤝 Collaboration

Dr. Valérie Doyère – NeuroPSI, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS
Specialist in cross-species comparative neuroscience

💡 Funding

This project is supported by the National Science Centre (NCN), Poland, under the OPUS Grant No. 2019/35/B/HS6/04389
Title: “Dynamics of Neuronal Processes Underlying Temporal Error Monitoring in Humans and Rats”

Would you like me to make a version with badges and links (e.g., ORCID, institutional pages, publication list, and GitHub repos) to make it look more like a professional open-science lab README? It can really help with visibility and attribution.

You said:
where is linkeding things?
ChatGPT said:

Excellent point — adding LinkedIn and other professional links (for lab visibility, researcher identification, and networking) will make your README much stronger.

Here’s an improved version of your README.md that includes LinkedIn, ORCID, institutional, and collaboration links placeholders — you can replace them with the actual URLs when ready:
